# Raytracer

This is a raytracer that is built following Peter Shirley's incredible book on ray tracing: [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html). 

## Instructions to run
```sh
cargo run > image_file.ppm
```

It is highly suggested that the raytracer is run in release mode, as it is incerdibly slow otherwise.

## Future plans
- Implementing Perlin textures
- Implementing Quadrilaterals and light sources that will allow a Cornell Box
- (Unlikely) Implementing BVH to speed up the raytracer.
